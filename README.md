CS-465 Fullstack Development with MEAN

Journal Reflection

Architecture

-In my full stack project I used various frontend development approaches such as express, html, javascript, and single page application. Each have their perks like with static html pages they are straight forward and dont change dynamically based on user interactions. With Express editing common elements like headers were easier because of centralized templates. Single page application (SPA) loads the entire HTML, CSS, and images on the first page for faster navigation speeds
-The choice to use NoSQL and MongoDB database is because of MongoDB scaleability, flexibility, and support for complex data structures made it a good choice for our backend


Functionality

- JSON is commonly used for data exchanges between servers and webpages while JavaScript is used for dynamic behaviour within web applications.
- An instance I refactored the code was when implementing the trip-card-listing compared to the trip-list components. Having two seperate components that render the same thing is inefficient but having each trip card render seperatly to be part of the whole is better for the site overall.
- Reusing UI is beneficial because it decreases overall size, makes development quicker, and decreases the chance of errors.


Testing

- There are a few methods for testing API endpoints before adding additional security. You can visit the localhost web address to the specific endpoint yo make sure it renders correctly or you can use an application like postman that tests the API and takes security into account like being able to add specific inputs during testing.


Reflection

- This course has helped me better understand the amount of work that goes into fullstack development. I am very interested in learning more about front end development and building up my skills so I can land a good career im this competive market.
